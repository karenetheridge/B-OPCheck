=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use B::Generate; # to change things

    use B::OPCheck entersub => check => sub {
        my $op = shift; # op has been checked by normal PL_check
        sodomize($op);
    };

    foo(); # this entersub will have the callback triggered

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PL_check is an array indexed by opcode number (op_type) that contains function
pointers invoked as the last stage of optree compilation, per op.

This hook is called in bottom up order, as the code is parsed and the optree is
prepared.

This is how modules like L<autobox> do their magic

This module provides an api for registering PL_check hooks lexically, allowing
you to alter the behavior of certain ops using L<B::Generate> from perl space.

=head1 CHECK TYPES

=over 4

=item check

Called after normal PL_checking. The return value is ignored.

=item after

Not yet implemented.

Allows you to return a processed B::OP. The op has been processed by PL_check
already.

=item before

Not yet implemented.

Allows you to return a processed B::OP to be passed to normal PL_check.

=item replace

Not yet implemented.

Allows you to return a processed B::OP yourself, skipping normal PL_check
handling completely.
